      <h1>The Adventures of Verrnack & Blupirk</h1>

      <p>
        <strong><em>The Adventures of Verrnack & Blupirk</em></strong> is a minimalist
        science-fiction comic about two extraterrestrial observers attempting to make
        sense of human logic, customs, and decision-making. Through short, self-contained
        panels, the comic explores misunderstandings, overconfidence, premature
        conclusions, and the quiet absurdities that arise when simple rules are applied
        to complex systems. The series avoids politics, religion, violence, and sexuality,
        focusing instead on curiosity, humor, and the universal challenge of interpreting
        a world that rarely behaves as expected.

      <h2>Creator’s Note</h2>

      <p>
        I originally created Verrnack & Blupirk as a way to explore curiosity,
        misunderstanding, and the unintended consequences of applying neat rules to
        messy systems. The comic has no fixed schedule and no overarching narrative;
        panels appear when an idea insists on being drawn. This site exists to preserve
        those moments, not to optimize them.
