    <h1>The Adventures of Verrnack & Blupirk</h1>
    <p>
      <b><i>The Adventures of Verrnack & Blupirk</i></b> is a minimalist science-fiction comic about two extraterrestrial observers
      attempting to make sense of human logic, customs, and decision-making. Through short, self-contained panels, the comic explores
      misunderstandings, overconfidence, premature conclusions, and the quiet absurdities that arise when simple rules are applied to
      complex systems. The series avoids politics, religion, violence, and sexuality, focusing instead on curiosity, humor, and the
      universal challenge of interpreting a world that rarely behaves as expected.

    <h2>Creator's Note</h2>
    <p>
      I originally created Verrnack & Blupirk as a way to explore curiosity, misunderstanding, and the unintended consequences of
      applying neat rules to messy systems. The comic has no fixed schedule and no overarching narrative; panels appear when an idea
      insists on being drawn. This site exists to preserve those moments, not to optimize them.
